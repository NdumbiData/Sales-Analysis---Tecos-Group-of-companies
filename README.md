# Sales Performance Analysis and Forecasting  

##  Project Overview  
This project is part of a broader analysis for Tecos Group of Companies, focusing on sales data to enhance forecasting and revenue optimization. It includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using both neural networks (LSTM) and classification models.  

##  Key Objectives  
- Perform comprehensive EDA to uncover sales patterns and trends.  
- Develop predictive sales models using LSTM neural networks.  
- Implement classification models for alternative forecasting techniques.  
- Provide actionable insights to optimize sales strategies.  

##  Data Sources  
- **Sales Dataset:** Contains transactional data, product sales, and regional performance metrics.  

##  Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning:** LSTM neural networks, classification models  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau
